    <h1>(h1) Web Design Run Through</h1>
    <h3>This is an example of a header tag. The text above is also a header tag. You will see it is automatically bolded, and depending on the number, it will change sizes. (This is h3)</h3>
    <p>(p) A paragraph tag is used to write smaller pieces of information in more structured sentences. You will also notice that the boldness disappears, and the text is much smaller than a header.</p>
    <h5 style = "color: blue;">(h5)U can also add color as well. This example is through the use of "inline" styling where you write your style in the same line as the code.</h5>
    <div>
        <p>(p) A div tag allows you to control a certain section of code at a time. As you can see the color doesn't change. This is due to Internal Styling where it specifies all div tags to have the same color no matter whether if u use a paragraph tag or a header.</p>
        <h2>(h2) See?</h2>
        <p>(p) Take an additional notice on how all these tags are aligned. (Another example of internal style) :> </p>
    </div>
    <h3>(h3) Now dat we are writing outside the div, the text goes back to normal.</h3>
